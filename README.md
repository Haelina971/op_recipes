The Odin Project Recipe Website!
Assignment for the Odin Project:
Make a recipe website only using HTML for practice purpose.
I tried to use a little of everything we learned in the HTML part of the Foundation Path.
The contact form is fake and will only redirect to another webpage, this is why the method attribute is empty.
Even if the recipes look real, they are probably unaccurate and it is recommended to not try them.
